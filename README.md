#### *Good interfaces are not added at the end — they are designed from the start.*
## **`👋 Hi, I’m Mihai`**
I’m a Frontend-leaning Full-Stack Web Developer with a strong focus on UI, UX, and product clarity, building real-world web applications primarily using PHP & Laravel.

I enjoy turning complex requirements into clean, usable interfaces, while fully understanding and maintaining the backend systems that power them.



## 🎨 Frontend focus

* UI & layout logic (spacing, hierarchy, responsiveness) 

* Blade templates, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap

* Dark / light mode handling

* Accessibility & visual consistency

* Data-driven UI (dashboards, calendar heatmaps)

* UX decisions based on real usage, not assumptions

*Frontend is where I’m most comfortable — and where I spend most of my attention.*

## 🧩 Backend foundations

* PHP (5.6 → 8.x)

* Laravel (5.8 → 12.x)

* Routing, controllers, middleware, auth

* MySQL, migrations, data modeling

* Webhooks, forms, integrations

* Legacy system maintenance & refactoring

*I don’t treat backend as a black box — I understand it well enough to design better frontend solutions and avoid architectural friction.*

## 🛠 Tools & workflow

* Git & structured branching

* VS Code, Laragon

* Composer, environment management

* GA4, GTM, Cookiebot, technical SEO

* Clean commits, readable code, incremental improvements

*I value clarity, structure, and long-term maintainability over quick hacks.*

## 🚀 Projects & interests

* Minimal, offline-first habit tracking tools

* UI-driven dashboards & visualizations

* Product-oriented web platforms

* Photography & visual aesthetics

* Mechanical & 3D design (engineering mindset)

*These interests strongly influence how I think about interfaces, systems, and user experience.*

## 🧠 How I work

* I prefer simple, predictable solutions

* I focus on real products, not demo apps

* I care about the next developer who reads my code

* I ask questions to reduce long-term technical debt

## 📫 Open to

* Collaboration

* Frontend-heavy or full-stack roles

* Improving existing products

* UX-driven technical discussions

*The most practical way to change "who you are" is to change "what you do".*
